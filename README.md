# Distributed P2P File Transfer System

## How to run the code:

Make sure you have docker installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). After installing docker, you can run the following commands to run the code:

1. Start the bootstrap and peer nodes by running the following command:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build --scale peer=3
```
This command will start 3 peer nodes at once. If there is already a peer node running, this command will start 2 more peer nodes.

2. Once the bootstrap and peer nodes running, you can find the container id of each of the nodes by running the following:
```bash
docker container ls
```
3. Once you obtain the container ID of the bootstrap and peer nodes, you can run the following command to initiate the chord network and see the logs of the nodes:
```bash 
docker exec -it file-sharing-system-chord-50041-bootstrap-1 bash
fts

docker exec -it file-sharing-system-chord-50041-peer-1 bash
fts

docker exec -it file-sharing-system-chord-50041-peer-2 bash
fts

docker exec -it file-sharing-system-chord-50041-peer-3 bash
fts
```
4. Once you are done with the execution, you can stop the containers by running the following command:
```bash
docker compose down
```
